          As an official AECES member this S.Y. 2019-2020, you are eligible to
          vote for the candidates running to be the next Executive Board. It is
          your responsibility as a voter to (1) be knowledgeable of the plans
          and platforms of the candidates before voting and (2) to only vote
          according to your own decision and not anyone else's.
          <br />
          <br />
          The AECES COMELEC, on the other hand, is responsible for keeping any
          details that involve the identity of the voter confidential in any
          circumstances. Only details that would contribute to the overall
          tallying of votes for the elections will be gathered in order to
          determine the official list of elected Executive Board members for the
          incoming school year.
